      "Freud (1856-1939) is considered the father of psychoanalysis. He introduced several fundamental concepts, including the unconscious mind, dream analysis, the Oedipus complex, and the psycho-sexual stages of development. He believed that early childhood experiences, especially those related to sexuality and the family, shape personality and behavior. Freud's theories were often controversial and provocative, and his methods, which included free association and the use of dreams, were groundbreaking. His work has had a profound impact on psychology, psychiatry, and Western culture as a whole. Freud's most famous works include \"The Interpretation of Dreams,\" \"Three Essays on Sexuality,\" and \"Civilization and Its Discontents.\"\n"
